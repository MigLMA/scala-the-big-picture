# Scala: The Big Picture
### by Harit Himanshu

## Description

Scala is one of the most popular functional programming languages that run on the JVM. This course covers the fundamentals of functional programming using Scala, reading and writing Scala code, error handling, classes, and concurrency.

Functional programming requires learning new programming paradigms, and Scala is an excellent language with which to do so. In this course, Scala: The Big Picture, you will learn the Scala language from scratch as a first step in your journey to master the language. First, you will learn the basics of functional programming which you’ll apply throughout the rest of the course. Next, you will explore the Scala language, from the basic syntax to functions, classes, collections, and pattern matching. Finally, you will discover how to do concurrent programming the right way using Scala. When you’re finished with this course, you will have the foundational knowledge needed to solve problems using Scala, and will know how to get help when needed.
